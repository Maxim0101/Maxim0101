## 🧑‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m Maxim — a Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science student at Northeastern University with a deep passion for software development, robotics, and business. I’m driven by curiosity, a love for learning, and a desire to understand how things truly work.

If I had to sum myself up, I’m someone who, when faced with a problem, doesn’t complain or walk away — I lean in. I find a genuine thrill in tackling complex challenges and creating meaningful, long-term solutions.

My fascination with technology began in high school, watching Boston Dynamics' robots in action via YouTube. That curiosity evolved into a passion for how software and engineering shape the future. With AI accelerating rapidly, I am confident robots will one day be as common as smartphones — and I want to help shape that future.

Eventually, I hope to launch a robotics company focused on ethical automation — building tools that empower workers rather than replace them. Further down the road, I also dream of starting an engineering-focused philanthropic initiative to help solve real-world problems and support the development of 3rd world states.

Right now, I’m diving deep into MySQL, Java, and supervised learning, and currently reading:
- The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book by Andriy Burkov
- Chip War by Chris Miller
- Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson

Outside of tech, I enjoy comedy, investing, and exploring thought-provoking shows like Black Mirror.

I’ve worked on a number of fun, entrepreneurial project ideas, and I have hands-on experience in both software and hardware, with a range of tools, languages, and IDEs.

I’m currently seeking my first software engineering internship, where I can apply my skills to real-world projects, learn from industry professionals, and contribute meaningfully to the future of tech.

Let’s connect and see how we can collaborate!
