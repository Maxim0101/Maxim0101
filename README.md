## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science student at Northeastern University with a deep passion for software development, robotics, entrepreneurship, and AGI. I’m driven by curiosity, a love for learning, and a desire to understand how EVERYTHING works. I’m someone who admittedly gets carried away with my ambitious ideas, but I am a great problem solver who finds a genuine thrill in tackling complex challenges and creating meaningful, long-term solutions. 

In the coming decade, I will be launching a robotics company focused on ethical automation — building tools that empower workers rather than replace them. And further down the road, I will start an engineering-focused philanthropic initiative to help solve global issues and support the development of 3rd world states. Why robotics? My fascination with robotics began in high school, watching [Boston Dynamics' robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn3KWM1kuAw) in action via YouTube. It's fascinating to see something artificial that thinks, moves, and makes decisions. It's also one of the most complex fields because a great robot requires the perfect mechanical design and the perfect AI. With AI accelerating rapidly, I am confident that robots will soon be more common than smartphones — and I want to help shape that future.

Until then, I want to start by getting my first internship, where I can apply my skills to real-world projects, learn from industry professionals, and connect with ambitious coworkers. I am looking for jobs in Robotics, Software Engineering, or Machine Learning for the summer of 2026, but I am open to other industries as well. If you are interested in my skills or want to simply connect and talk, don't be afraid to reach out! 

## A little more about my skills, tech stack, and current studies ##

I regularly challenge myself with complex problems on Project Euler and CodingBat. I supplement my learning through online resources like freeCodeCamp, Coursera, and YouTube. This month (October 2025), I'm practicing my skills in Front End Development (via the Odin Project), Machine Learning, and Neural Networks. 

The most advanced project I am working on and will finish by the end of winter is my voice assistant, MAI. This project utilizes OpenAI's API, open-sourced packages, and hardware like the RPI4, Respeaker, OLED, and more. The goal is to make an assistant buddy that is smarter and more natural than Siri, Alexa, or Cortana. It will be able to talk naturally, examine its environment, make faces with the OLED, remember people, remember conversations, and execute commands like "record a video of me" or "generate an image and send it to me via email". 

I am currently reading:
- The Coming Wave: Technology, Power, and the Twenty-first Century's Greatest Dilemma by Mustafa Suleyman
- 1984 by Orwell George
- The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book by Andriy Burkov

If you want to see more of my projects, you can find some of them on my Github page. 

Along the way, I’ve gained hands-on experience across both software and hardware, using tools and IDEs like VS Code, Xcode, DataGrip, and Zsh, and languages like Python, Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL. I have foundational skills in Mechanical Engineering, Hardware Engineering, Software Engineering, Robotics, and Machine Learning.
