## üßë‚Äçüíª About Me

Hi, I‚Äôm Maxim ‚Äî a Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science student at Northeastern University with a deep passion for software development, robotics, and business. I‚Äôm driven by curiosity, a love for learning, and a desire to understand how things truly work.

If I had to sum myself up, I‚Äôm someone who, when faced with a problem, doesn‚Äôt complain or walk away ‚Äî I lean in. I find a genuine thrill in tackling complex challenges and creating meaningful, long-term solutions.

My fascination with technology began in high school, watching [Boston Dynamics' robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn3KWM1kuAw) in action via YouTube. That curiosity evolved into a passion for learning how software and engineering shape the future. With AI accelerating rapidly, I am confident that robots will be as common as smartphones ‚Äî and I want to help shape that future.

Eventually, I will launch a robotics company focused on ethical automation ‚Äî building tools that empower workers rather than replace them. And further down the road, I will start an engineering-focused philanthropic initiative to help solve real-world problems and support the development of 3rd world states.

I regularly challenge myself with complex problems on Project Euler and supplement my learning through platforms like freeCodeCamp, Codecademy, and YouTube. Right now, I‚Äôm diving deeper into MySQL, Java, and supervised learning, and currently reading:
- The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book by Andriy Burkov
- Chip War by Chris Miller
- Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson

Outside of tech, I enjoy comedy, investing, and exploring thought-provoking shows like Black Mirror.

I have worked on several fun and entrepreneurial projects, including a voice assistant built with OpenAI‚Äôs API. I‚Äôm currently developing a financial learning app, an app for my college, my first AI, and more. Along the way, I‚Äôve gained hands-on experience across both software and hardware, using tools and IDEs like VS Code, Xcode, DataGrip, and Zsh, and languages like Python, Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL.

I‚Äôm currently seeking my first software engineering internship, where I can apply my skills to real-world projects, learn from industry professionals, and contribute meaningfully to the future of tech.

Let's connect!
